# Python-add-text-or-logo-watermark
This is just the first working version of a watermarking program written in Python.

Right now it will just open the image with the watermark and the GUI is only there for the 2 buttons.
Things i want to add are to also open the window inside Tkinter, improve the UI and the resolutions so that it stops resizing and pushing away the buttons
Make the ui more static with a resized image showing inside the window and the fullsize image opening with the local gallery app.
Set the position of the text or logo inside the GUI instead of hardcoded values
Combine the two watermark functions into one and check if it's text or a file path
